- 👋 Hi, I’m @GhastSlayer007
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and game development. I like using Unity and the Unreal Engine, as well as programs like Pycharm.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Unity and scripting in C#.
- 💞️ Aside from software development, I like building and repairing computers, or really anything with a circuit board.
- 📫 I love to learn and I'm currently studying for my CompTIA A+ exams.
